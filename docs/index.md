# Overview

Welcome! This site serves as a home base for more detailed information on how to install, use, and learn about the project.

The original focus of this project was to learn another programming language to accompany my skills in Python and SQL.
So, I chose Golang and set out to build a CLI/TUI tool for a project.

This project has gone beyond a CLI/TUI tool and incorporates some DevOps and Data Engineering practices such as CI/CD pipelines
with GitHub Actions and data pipelines with Airflow and AWS, respectively.
