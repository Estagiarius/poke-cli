# Overview

**Welcome!**

This site is the central hub for detailed information on how to install, use, and learn about this project.

The project originally began as a way to explore a new programming language to complement my existing skills in Python and SQL. 
I chose Go (Golang) and set out to build a CLI/TUI tool.

Since then, the scope has expanded beyond a simple CLI/TUI. It now incorporates DevOps and Data Engineering practices, 
including CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and data workflows using Airflow and AWS.

## Demo
Here is a quick demo of the CLI/TUI tool in action.
